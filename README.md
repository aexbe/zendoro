*A minimalist and elegant productivity + self-diary manager app.*

## 🌱 Story Behind Zendoro

Alright, so here’s the real talk: we totally get it.  
Ever felt like your day just *vanishes* into a black hole of distractions? One minute you’re starting a task, the next you’re three hours deep into cat videos. We’ve been there too.  

That nagging feeling of *"I should be doing something productive"* but somehow always ending up elsewhere? That’s exactly why we built **Zendoro**.  

Inspired by the legendary **Pomodoro Technique**, Zendoro isn’t just another timer—it’s a digital sidekick that keeps you grounded, celebrates your small wins, and gives you space to recharge. Think of it as your gentle-but-firm productivity buddy that makes your workflow smoother than a fresh jar of peanut butter.  

We genuinely believe productivity should feel natural and satisfying—not overwhelming.  
**Happy focusing – we built this for *you*!**
